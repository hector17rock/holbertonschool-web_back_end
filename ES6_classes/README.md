# ES6 Classes

This project contains exercises and examples for ES6 classes.

Requirements:
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All your files should end with a new line (enforced via ESLint `eol-last`)
- A README.md file at the root of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the .js extension (ES modules enabled via `type: module`)
- Your code will be tested using Jest and the command `npm run test`
- Your code will be verified against lint using ESLint
- Your code needs to pass all the tests and lint. You can verify the entire project running `npm run full-test`

Getting started:
- Install dependencies: `npm install`

Scripts:
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Test: `npm test` or `npm run test`
- Dev (run a file with Node): `npm run dev -- <file.js>`
- Full test (lint + tests): `npm run full-test`

Example:
- Implement the class in `0-classroom.js`
- Run the example: `npm run dev -- 0-main.js`

Notes:
- ESLint rules are configured in `eslint.config.js` (flat config for ESLint 9)
- Jest is configured in `jest.config.js`, Babel in `babel.config.js`
- Newline at end of file is enforced; ensure your editor is configured accordingly
